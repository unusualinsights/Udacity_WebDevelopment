Preparatory Steps
-----------------

Install Google App Engine and Python 2.7 as described in the Google App Engine
installation web pages.

I don't remember if there were any special steps beyond this; just ensure that
your Cygwin path (check it with the command "echo $PATH") contains something
like "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine", so you can run
the console (command-line) version of Google App Engine, which I think is
simpler than the GUI version.

Also, python may not be in your path.  To have Cygwin add python to your path
automatically when it starts (without altering your system path in general in
Windows), add the line "export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python27:$PATH" to your
.bashrc file in your $HOME directory.

Then close that Cygwin window and open a new one.  Type "python --version" to
see if python is now in your Cygwin bash shell's path.  It should output
something that looks like "Python 2.7.6".

Alternatively, a handy one-line command for adding something to the PATH in
your .bashrc file is:

echo export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python27:\$PATH >> ~/.bashrc

(Note the "\$" is there in the command above, to indicate the "$" symbol as a
 part of the string to be echoed, rather than some other UNIX symbol.  The >>
 symbol tells the shell to append the echoed string,
 "export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python27:$PATH", to your .bashrc file.)

In the Udacity exercise, once you create helloworld.py and app.yaml as
specified in the instructions, the command that worked for me in Cygwin for
running the Python hello world program from the "helloworld" folder was:

/cygdrive/c/Python27/python "`cygpath -w /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Google/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py`" --port 8888 .

Note, you have to hit [Enter] TWICE to make this work!!

Then, in a web browser, navigate to "localhost:8888" and you will see
"Hello, Udacity!" being displayed.

See the "helloworld" folder for the Python programs for this homework
assignment.

Note that every time you hit refresh, the "GET / HTTP/1.1" request shows up in
the output of the running Python program.
